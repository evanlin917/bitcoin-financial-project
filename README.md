# bitcoin-financial-project
From Sololearn's Python in Finance course, but with a few adjustments. 
Some Python packages used in this project include NumPy, Matplotlib, yFinance, and NumPy-Financial.
NumPy is a package in Python that allows for mathematical functions and operations to be applied upon various types of data types.
Matplotlib is mainly a visualization package, used to design various types of charts and graphs to illustrate trends seen in data.
yFinance is a package that allows the accessing of financial information and data from Yahoo Finance webpages through the processs of web scraping.
NumPy-Financial is a package very similar to Python except it features functions more oriented towards financial situations.
